#Specifications - LPMC Casino

##Overview
This is a functional specification, designed to give direction as to how the user will interact with the applet. 
It is not intended to be a piece of technical documentation, nor is it a complete list of needed features or ideas.
It is merely a starting point in order to have a framework with which to work from. Technical decisions such as how data
is moved around the program are left to the discretion of the programmer.

###Login Page
This is the primary gateway into the application. It's a simple user\name password input form,
that is also able to give back basic feedback.

####Usage Case
Felicity wants to play blackjack, because she as a crippling gambling addiction and can never get enough. Unfortunately for her,
she lives in Georgia where there aren't any casinos. She stumbles upon our website, and immediately goes to start playing. She 
realizes that first she needs to create an account, so she presses the "Create New Account" button, and gets sent to that page,
and from there she goes on to lose all her fake money trying to split 6s, because she has no idea what she's doing.

The next day, Felicity comes back for more. She realizes in a fit of brilliance she already has an account, and types in her username.
She didn't remember her password, however, and sits there for a bit stumped and presses the "Quit" button, which closes the page. 
After going and getting some coffee and reloading the page, she notices the "Forgot your username or password?" button, and clicks it. 
After heading to that page and using her email to recover her password, she returns to the login page and types it in.
She presses login, and is taken into the land of gambling goodness.

####TODO
- A text box labelled "Username" used to input your username
- A text box labelled "Password" used to input your password (Blocked out by *s)
- A status output that tells the user if they were unsuccessful
- A button marked "Login" that allows you to login. This button can be pressed by hitting enter as well.
- A button marked "Create New Account" that takes you to the create new account screen.
- A button marked "Forgot your username or password?"
- A title\header that reads "Learn Programming Casino" in some sans serif font
- A button marked "Quit" used to close the applet
