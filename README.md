LPMCCasino
==========

A Java applet to play games at a casino

As a rough sketch, here's generally what this project will consist of. 
It will be a GUI based Java program that allows you to play various gambling games. It will consist of the following pages:

- Splash Page
- Login Page
- Home Page
- Game Pages for the following games:
    - Slots
    - Blackjack
    - Roulette
    - Craps
    - Texas Hold 'em
    
Now of course this won't be with real money, and will be entirely for fun. 
Principles of the project are in the specifications.md document, and a best practices document is soon to come, but for now
the general idea is good, clean, well object oriented code with an emphasis on doing it right, not just getting it done.
