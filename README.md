LPMCCasino
==========
##Newcomers Start Here
Hello, glad to see you're interested in the LPMCCasino. This is a Java project that will utilize the Swing library to
make a Casino applet, to be placed inline in a web browser. 

This project probably works a bit differently than maybe your school assignments or other projects within the LPMC.
This project is more formal, and is supposed to expose you to a more realistic approach to software development. 

How it works is that I have written a lot of spec (Specifications). They're in the specifications.md file, and they
detail both how a user should interact with something, as well as a list of features that need to be included. You
then decide the technical implementation and write it yourself. 

Your technical decision must be consistant with both
the project code that has already been written, and the best practices document I have written. If it isn't, your 
pull request will be declined, with an explanation so you can go back and fix it. 

It's all a bit formal, but hopefully it should be fun and give you some great experience into how developing software 
really works.

###What You Should Do Next
Head over to the func-spec.md and tech-spec.md and read through it, see what is still listed on the TODO list, and what has been completed.
Find something you think you can implement, pull up (Or create) the appropriate file, and get to it! If you have questions,
join us on #Lpmc on irc.freenode.net.

##Basic Description
A Java applet to play games at a casino

As a rough sketch, here's generally what this project will consist of. 
It will be a GUI based Java program that allows you to play various gambling games. It will consist of the following pages:

- Splash Page
- Login Page
- Home Page
- Game Pages for the following games:
    - Slots
    - Blackjack
    - Roulette
    - Craps
    - Texas Hold 'em
    
Now of course this won't be with real money, and will be entirely for fun. 
Principles of the project are in the specifications.md document, and a best practices document is soon to come, but for now
the general idea is good, clean, well object oriented code with an emphasis on doing it right, not just getting it done.
