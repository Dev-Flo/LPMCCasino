#Technical Specifications - LPMC Casino

##Overview
This is the technical specification of the LPMC Casino. It is designed to provide technical direction for the creation
of the game and administration logic (AKA: backend). These specifications should serve as a guide, if there is a
legitimate reason to deviate from the specification, this is understandable. 

##High Level Interaction
There are five layers to this application:
####Client side
- Presentation Layer
    - The presentation layer is either:
        - The Java GUI Applet built on Swing
        - The IRC outputs of a bot
- Client Communication Layer
    - The client communication layer is either:
        - Java code running within the applet
        - The communication logic of the IRC bot
    Both communication layers follow the syntax defined within the API specification of this document.

####Server side
- Server Communication Layer
    - This layer provides a language agnostic representation of game and client states, to be consumed by the client
    communication layers.
- Logic Layer
    - The primary logic repository. All game logic and execution will happen in this layer, to be passed back to the
    server communication layer for consumption.
- Database Layer
    - This layer is primarily a wrapper to the SQL database that holds the relevant player information.

And they interact linearly as such:

             Database Layer

##API Specification
###Basic Descrption
This API is a language agnostic syntax used to communicate between the client and server layers, allowing independence
of implementation between client and server. 

###General Guidelines
- This is a raw socket connection, which uses a stream of string information to communicate between client and server.
- Overall syntax considerations:
    - A distinct information block (eg: A login request or a bet from one of the games) will be bound by two pipes (||).
    - Immediately following the pipes will be the name of the block of information
    - The data of a information block will be delimited from the name by two colons (::)
    - Varying pieces of data within that command block will delimited by a pipe (|)
    - Each piece of data will be set off by a standardized identifier, and identified by a standardized naming 
    scheme followed by a colon (:)
    - The data will continue in this fashion until the next double pipe (||) is met, marking the end of that
    information block
    - All of these identifying marks, should they need to be included in a datastream, will be escaped using a 
    blackslash (\\).
