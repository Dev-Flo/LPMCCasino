#API Specification - LPMC Casino
##Basic Descrption
This API is a language agnostic syntax used to communicate between the client and server layers, allowing independence
of implementation between client and server. 

##General Guidelines
- This is a raw socket connection, which uses a stream of string information to communicate between client and server.
- Overall syntax considerations:
    - A distinct information block (eg: A login request or a bet from one of the games) will be bound by two pipes (||).
    - Immediately following the pipes will be the name of the block of information
    - The data of a information block will be delimited from the name by two colons (::)
    - Varying pieces of data within that command block will delimited by a pipe (|)
    - Each piece of data will be set off by a standardized identifier, and identified by a standardized naming 
    scheme followed by a colon (:)
    - The data will continue in this fashion until the next double pipe (||) is met, marking the end of that
    information block
    - All of these identifying marks, should they need to be included in a datastream, will be escaped using a 
    blackslash (\\).
    - These blocks are case insentitive, but good practices calls for all lower case

Example:

    ||userinfo::user:locke|email:locke@uga.edu|currency:dollar|money:500||
